# Unfair-Slots
Finished slot machine made in python that totally doesn't favor the house 


This is a Python code for a slot machine game. The program allows the user to deposit an amount of money, select the number of lines they want to bet on, and the bet amount per line. Then, the program displays the slot machine with symbols randomly generated by the computer. If the symbols match in a line, the user wins a certain amount of money depending on the symbol and the bet amount. The program continues to prompt the user to play until they quit or run out of money.


User Input: The program prompts the user to enter the amount of money they want to deposit, the number of lines they want to bet on, and the bet amount per line. The program also validates the user input to ensure it's a valid number within the appropriate range.

Generating Symbols: The program generates symbols randomly using the Python random module. The program uses a dictionary to define the number of symbols of each type and their values, and how it creates a list of all the symbols and randomly selects them to generate the slot machine.

Checking Winnings: The program checks for winning lines by comparing the symbols on each line. The program uses a for loop to iterate through each line and check if all symbols are the same. If they are, the program calculates the winnings based on the symbol value and bet amount.

Displaying Results: The program displays the slot machine with the symbols generated and prints the user's winnings and the lines they won on. The program uses a function to display the slot machine, and how it prints the results using formatted strings.

Main Function: The main() function runs the game loop, where the user is prompted to play until they quit or run out of money. The program calculates the user's balance and calls the necessary functions to prompt the user to play and display the results.
